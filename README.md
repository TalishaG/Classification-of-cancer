# Cancer Classification using Microarray Gene Expression

This repository contains R Markdown (`.Rmd`) scripts used for the cancer classification presented in this study. The code implements hybrid feature engineering approaches, including PKPB meta-feature construction, Entropy- and PLS-based feature selection, and classification using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) as well as classical machine learning classifiers.
